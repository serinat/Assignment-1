    <h3>This is your first assignment. (Don't look so grumpy..)</h3>
    <p>As a developer for the first time, use basic markup to structure your index.html
    page so that the layout is in the order of assembly of your preference.  Secondly,
    receive and use the user's name so that the program is personalized to the user's
    experience.  Lastly, if you're feeling adventurous, use a simple online tool
    (<b>github</b>) to share your code.</p>
    <p>Some technical requirements will be to a) display good use of HTML (using
    'doctype', 'html', 'body', 'h1', 'p1' and 'title') in <b>Atom</b>, paying close
    attention to readability and organization (writing clean code and using proper
    indentation), and b) to use Javascript to alert the user in a"Hello, World" type
    of script.</p>
    <p>When you are done, submit your code via Canvas (copy and paste into submission
    box). <b><i>GOOD LUCK!!!</b></i></p>

    <p><b><i>Sidenote: If everyone turns in their assignment on time, Seahawks playoff
    game streaming in this Sunday class!!! </b></i><i class="em em---1"></i>

    <script type="text/javascript">
    var userName = prompt('What\'s your name?');
    alert("Hello" + " " + userName + " " + "Welcome to Code Fellows 201!");</script>
