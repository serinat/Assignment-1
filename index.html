    <h3>This is your first assignment</h3>
    <p>As a developer for the first time, use basic markup to
    structure your index.html page so that the layout is in the order of assembly
    of your preference.  Secondly, receive and use the user's name so that
    the program is personalized to the user's experience.  Lastly, use a simple
    online tool to share your code.</p>
    <p>Some technical requirements will be to display good use of HTML (using
    'doctype', 'html', 'body', 'h1', 'p1' and 'title') in Atom, paying close
    attention to readability and organization (writing clean code and using proper
    indentation).  Finally, use Javascript to alert the user in a
    "Hello, World" type of script.</p>
    <p>When you are done, submit your code via Canvas (copy and paste into
    submission box). <i>Good Luck!!!</i></p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    var userName = prompt('What\'s your name?');
    alert("Hello" + " " + userName + " " + "Welcome to Code Fellows 201!");
    </script>
  </body>
